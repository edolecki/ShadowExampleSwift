# ShadowExampleSwift
A Swift 2.2 example of various drop shadow techniques that's all the rage with young whipper-snappers.

The only real thing that makes this a Swift 2.2 implementation is the "upgraded" selector for the .ValueChanged for the UIScrollView. Otherwise it's fairly standard Swift. 

I saw something very similar to this a while ago, and this is an improvement on what I saw (in presentation). If I can remember or find the site where someone had this linked to their Github project, I'll add that to the readme.
